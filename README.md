# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

This repo is my personal journey to learn **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** step by step, using **Python**.  
I am starting as a beginner, so everything here is organized in a very simple way.

## 📖 Learning Roadmap

### 1. Linear Data Structures
These store data **one after another** in a sequence:
- Arrays (Python lists)
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues

### 2. Non-linear Data Structures
These store data in **hierarchies or networks**:
- Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, etc.)
- Graphs

## 🛠️ Environment Setup
- Python 3 (latest version)
- Virtual environment in `.venv/`
- Install dependencies if needed:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
